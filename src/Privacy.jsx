          <h6>1. WHAT INFORMATION DO WE COLLECT?</h6>

          <p>
            <b>Personal information you disclose to us</b>
            <br />
            We collect personal information that you voluntarily provide to us
            when you express an interest in obtaining information about us or
            our products and Services, when you participate in activities on the
            Services or otherwise when you contact us. The personal information
            that we collect depends on the context of your interactions with us
            and the Services, the choices you make and the products and features
            you use. The personal information we collect may include the
            following: passwords; usernames; and other similar information. All
            personal information that you provide to us must be true, complete
            and accurate, and you must notify us of any changes to such personal
            information.
            <br />
            <br />
            <b>Information automatically collected</b>
            <br />
            We automatically collect certain information when you visit, use or
            navigate the Services. This information does not reveal your
            specific identity (like your name or contact information) but may
            include device and usage information, such as your IP address,
            browser and device characteristics, operating system, language
            preferences, referring URLs, device name, country, location,
            information about how and when you use our Services and other
            technical information. This information is primarily needed to
            maintain the security and operation of our Services, and for our
            internal analytics and reporting purposes. The information we
            collect includes:
            <ul>
              <li>
                Log and Usage Data. Log and usage data is service-related,
                diagnostic, usage and performance information our servers
                automatically collect when you access or use our Services and
                which we record in log files. Depending on how you interact with
                us, this log data may include your IP address, device
                information, browser type and settings and information about
                your activity in the Services (such as the date/time stamps
                associated with your usage, pages and files viewed, searches and
                other actions you take such as which features you use), device
                event information (such as system activity, error reports
                (sometimes called 'crash dumps') and hardware settings).
              </li>

              <li>
                Device Data. We collect device data such as information about
                your computer, phone, tablet or other device you use to access
                the Services. Depending on the device used, this device data may
                include information such as your IP address (or proxy server),
                device and application identification numbers, location, browser
                type, hardware model Internet service provider and/or mobile
                carrier, operating system and system configuration information.
              </li>

              <li>
                Location Data. We collect location data such as information
                about your device's location, which can be either precise or
                imprecise. How much information we collect depends on the type
                and settings of the device you use to access the Services. For
                example, we may use GPS and other technologies to collect
                geolocation data that tells us your current location (based on
                your IP address). You can opt out of allowing us to collect this
                information either by refusing access to the information or by
                disabling your Location setting on your device. Note however, if
                you choose to opt out, you may not be able to use certain
                aspects of the Services.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            <b>Information collected through our App</b>
            <br />
            If you use our App, we also collect the following information:
            Mobile Device Data. We automatically collect device information
            (such as your mobile device ID, model and manufacturer), operating
            system, version information and system configuration information,
            device and application identification numbers, browser type and
            version, hardware model, Internet service provider and/or mobile
            carrier, and Internet Protocol (IP) address (or proxy server). If
            you are using our App, we may also collect information about the
            phone network associated with your mobile device, your mobile
            device’s operating system or platform, the type of mobile device you
            use, your mobile device’s unique device ID and information about the
            features of our App you accessed. This information is primarily
            needed to maintain the security and operation of our App, for
            troubleshooting and for our internal analytics and reporting
            purposes.

              <li>
                Legal Obligations: We may disclose your information where we are
                legally required to do so in order to comply with applicable
                law, governmental requests, a judicial proceeding, court order,
                or legal process, such as in response to a court order or a
                subpoena (including in response to public authorities to meet
                national security or law enforcement requirements).
              </li>

              <li>
                Vital Interests: We may disclose your information where we
                believe it is necessary to investigate, prevent, or take action

                situations involving potential threats to the safety of any
                person and illegal activities, or as evidence in litigation in
                which we are involved.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <br />
            More specifically, we may need to process your data or share your
            personal information in the following situations:

              <li>
                Business Transfers. We may share or transfer your information in
                connection with, or during negotiations of, any merger, sale of
                company assets, financing, or acquisition of all or a portion of
                our business to another company.
              </li>
              <li>
                Vendors, Consultants and Other Third-Party Service Providers. We
                may share your data with third-party vendors, service providers,
                contractors or agents who perform services for us or on our
                behalf and require access to such information to do that work.
                Examples include: payment processing, data analysis, email
                delivery, hosting services, customer service and marketing
                efforts. We may allow selected third parties to use tracking
                technology on the Services, which will enable them to collect
                data on our behalf about how you interact with our Services over
                time. This information may be used to, among other things,
                analyze and track data, determine the popularity of certain
                content, pages or features, and better understand online
                activity. Unless described in this notice, we do not share,
                sell, rent or trade any of your information with third parties
                for their promotional purposes. We have contracts in place with
                our data processors, which are designed to help safeguard your
                personal information. This means that they cannot do anything
                with your personal information unless we have instructed them to
                do it. They will also not share your personal information with
                any organization apart from us. They also commit to protect the
                data they hold on our behalf and to retain it for the period we
                instruct.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h6>3. WHO WILL YOUR INFORMATION BE SHARED WITH?</h6>

          <p>
            We only share and disclose your information with the following third
            parties. If we have processed your data based on your consent and
            you wish to revoke your consent, please contact us using the contact
            details provided in the section below titled "HOW CAN YOU CONTACT US
            ABOUT THIS NOTICE?".
            <ul>
              <li>
                <u>Web and Mobile Analytics</u>
                <br />
                Google Analytics
              </li>
            </ul>
          </p>

          <h6>4. HOW LONG DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION?</h6>

          <p>
            We will only keep your personal information for as long as it is
            necessary for the purposes set out in this privacy notice, unless a
            longer retention period is required or permitted by law (such as
            tax, accounting or other legal requirements). When we have no
            ongoing legitimate business need to process your personal
            information, we will either delete or anonymize such information,
            or, if this is not possible (for example, because your personal
            information has been stored in backup archives), then we will
            securely store your personal information and isolate it from any
            further processing until deletion is possible.
          </p>

          <h6>5. HOW DO WE KEEP YOUR INFORMATION SAFE?</h6>

          <p>
            We have implemented appropriate technical and organizational
            security measures designed to protect the security of any personal
            information we process. However, despite our safeguards and efforts
            to secure your information, no electronic transmission over the
            Internet or information storage technology can be guaranteed to be
            100% secure, so we cannot promise or guarantee that hackers,
            cybercriminals, or other unauthorized third parties will not be able
            to defeat our security, and improperly collect, access, steal, or
            modify your information. Although we will do our best to protect
            your personal information, transmission of personal information to
            and from our Services is at your own risk. You should only access
            the Services within a secure environment.
          </p>

          <h6>6. DO WE COLLECT INFORMATION FROM MINORS?</h6>

          <p>
            We do not knowingly solicit data from or market to children under 18
            years of age. By using the Services, you represent that you are at
            least 18 or that you are the parent or guardian of such a minor and
            consent to such minor dependent’s use of the Services. If we learn
            that personal information from users less than 18 years of age has
            been collected, we will deactivate the account and take reasonable
            measures to promptly delete such data from our records. If you
            become aware of any data we may have collected from children under
            age 18, please contact us at admin@yerbas.org.
          </p>

          <h6>7. WHAT ARE YOUR PRIVACY RIGHTS?</h6>

          <p>
            In some regions (like the EEA and UK), you have certain rights under
            applicable data protection laws. These may include the right (i) to
            request access and obtain a copy of your personal information, (ii)
            to request rectification or erasure; (iii) to restrict the
            processing of your personal information; and (iv) if applicable, to
            data portability. In certain circumstances, you may also have the
            right to object to the processing of your personal information. To
            make such a request, please use the contact details provided below.
            We will consider and act upon any request in accordance with
            applicable data protection laws.
            <br />
            <br />
            If we are relying on your consent to process your personal
            information, you have the right to withdraw your consent at any
            time. Please note however that this will not affect the lawfulness
            of the processing before its withdrawal, nor will it affect the
            processing of your personal information conducted in reliance on
            lawful processing grounds other than consent.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are a resident in the EEA or UK and you believe we are
            unlawfully processing your personal information, you also have the
            right to complain to your local data protection supervisory
            authority. You can find their contact details here:
            https://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/bodies/authorities/index_en.htm.
            <br />
            <br />
            If you are a resident in Switzerland, the contact details for the
            data protection authorities are available here:
            https://www.edoeb.admin.ch/edoeb/en/home.html.
          </p>

          <h6>8. CONTROLS FOR DO-NOT-TRACK FEATURES</h6>

          <p>
            Most web browsers and some mobile operating systems and mobile
            applications include a Do-Not-Track ("DNT") feature or setting you
            can activate to signal your privacy preference not to have data
            about your online browsing activities monitored and collected. At
            this stage no uniform technology standard for recognizing and
            implementing DNT signals has been finalized. As such, we do not
            currently respond to DNT browser signals or any other mechanism that
            automatically communicates your choice not to be tracked online. If
            a standard for online tracking is adopted that we must follow in the
            future, we will inform you about that practice in a revised version
            of this privacy notice.
          </p>

          <h6>9. DO WE MAKE UPDATES TO THIS NOTICE?</h6>

          <p>
            We may update this privacy notice from time to time. The updated
            version will be indicated by an updated "Revised" date and the
            updated version will be effective as soon as it is accessible. If we
            make material changes to this privacy notice, we may notify you
            either by prominently posting a notice of such changes or by
            directly sending you a notification. We encourage you to review this
            privacy notice frequently to be informed of how we are protecting
            your information.
